# Connecting the ADXL343 Accelerometer board to the PI 

![Full Block Diagram](assets/P2/blocks_lab2.png)

## Project 2 (DUE 1/28 11:59PM)

### Overview

In this project, you will be connecting an accelerometer board to the
Raspberry Pi. In the last lab, we used I2C to talk to the pressure
sensor. In this lab, we are going to be using Serial Peripheral
Interface (SPI) to connect to the ADXL343 accelerometer. You will be
creating a python class that enables the raspberry pi to interact with
the accelerometer.

### Resources
* [ADXL343 Datasheet](../docs/adxl343.pdf)
* [Adafruit ADXL343 Reference](https://learn.adafruit.com/adxl343-breakout-learning-guide)
* [spidev documentation](https://pypi.org/project/spidev/)

### Connecting the sensor board

You will be adding the accelerometer to the same breadboard as the
pressure sensor. Do not change the connections to your pressure
sensor. At the end of this lab, you should have both sensors wired and
functional.

| Raspberry Pi Pin  | ADXL343 Board  |
|-------------------|----------------|
| 5V                | VIN            |
| GND               | GND            |
| Pin 19 (SPI MOSI) | SDA            |
| Pin 21 (SPI MISO) | SDO/ALT ADDR   |
| Pin 23 (SPI SCK)  | SCL            |
| Pin 24 (SPI CE0)  | CS             |

### Python Class 

Similar to the LPS331 class that you wrote for project 1, you are
going to be writing a class that enables the control of the
accelerometer. You will be completing the following class to enable
the printing of the **floating point** x, y, and z accelerations. You will need to refer to 
the [datasheet](../docs/adxl343.pdf) to complete this work.

### What to turn in (DUE 1/28 11:59PM)

You and your partner should work to complete this module and commit it
to your repository. When you are satisfied with the code, go to canvas
and submit a link to a video of your code printing the x, y, and z
axis values.
