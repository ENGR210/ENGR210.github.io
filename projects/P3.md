# Reading and Writing to the System using MQTT

![Full Block Diagram](assets/P3/blocks_full.png)

## Project 3

### Overview

In this project, you will be connecting your system to a sensor
network via the MQTT protocol. This will involve creating a python
script that communicates the current temperature, pressure, and
accelerometer state to the mqtt broker. 

### Resources
* [MQTT Lecture](https://engr210.github.io/lectures/MQTT_SP22.pdf)
* [MQTT Text](https://iucat.iu.edu/catalog/18457908) 

### Packages to Installing 

You will need to install a couple of packages on your raspberry
pi. These packages are as follows:

```bash
sudo apt-get install python3-paho-mqtt mosquitto-clients
```
### Mosquitto Pub/Sub 

Once you have installed the packages above on your raspberry pi, you
will be able to run **mosquitto_pub** and **mosquitto_sub**. You can
find notes on how to use these commands in the reference materials
above along with the video from the MQTT lecture.

One of the items that you are required to turn in is a video of
receiving and transmitting messages from silo. To run
**mosquitto_pub** and **mosquitto_sub** on silo. These applications
are installed by default on the server.

### Sensor Template Code 

The following code is a template to get you started on your own
version of **sensor_node.py**. This code writes static variables to
the mqtt broker.

**The first thing that you should do in modifying this code is to
change sensor_id. This is the 6 digit number on the white IU tag on
your pi. This tag has a barcode on it.**

```python 

#!/usr/bin/env python3

import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import time

# White Bar Code Label Number on Each Raspberry Pi
sensor_id = 986304
temperature = 21
pressure = 31
x_acceleration = 0.001
y_acceleration = 0.002
z_acceleration = 1.001

def on_message(client, userdata, message):
#    print("topic:", message.topic)
    print("message:", message.payload.decode('UTF-8'))

def on_connect(client,userdata,flags,rc):
    pass
    
client = mqtt.Client()
client.on_message=on_message
client.on_connect=on_connect
client.connect("pivot.iuiot.org")
client.loop_start()
while(1):
    print("Publish Temperature, Pressure, and Accelerometer Data")
    client.publish(f"sensors/{sensor_id}/temperature",f"{temperature}")
    client.publish(f"sensors/{sensor_id}/pressure",f"{pressure}")
    client.publish(f"sensors/{sensor_id}/accel/x",f"{x_acceleration}")
    client.publish(f"sensors/{sensor_id}/accel/y",f"{y_acceleration}")
    client.publish(f"sensors/{sensor_id}/accel/z",f"{z_acceleration}")
    time.sleep(5)
```

### Adding Live Data 

In labs 1 and 2, you created classes that enable access to the
pressure/temperature sensor and the accelerometer. In this lab, you will be
using these classes to get the data needed to pass to the mqtt broker.

**You should copy your lps331ap.py and adxl343.py files to the
same directory as sensor_node.py.**

From your raspberry pi, you will be writing the temperature, pressure,
and accelerometer values to the mqtt topics shown in the template
code. You should send the data every 5 seconds. 

### What to turn in 

You and your partner should work to complete this module and commit it
to your repository. When you are satisfied with the code, go to canvas
and submit a video of your system running. The video should show the
temperature, pressure, and accelerometer messages arriving on the mqtt broker
pivot.iuiot.org (recall that you can use a wildcard to filter just
these messages). 

You should use mosquitto_sub on **silo** to subscribe to all of the
messages from your sensor.
