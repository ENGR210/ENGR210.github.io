# Connecting the Raspberry Pi and the Baysys3 Board 

![Full Block Diagram](art/blocks_full_GPIO.png)

## Project 7

### Overview

In this project, you will be connecting the Basys3 board to the
Raspberry Pi. This will be done with GPIO Pins. You will leverage your
experience from earlier this semester with System Verilog to design
the hardware that is instantiated on the Basys3 board. Additionally,
you will be creating a python class that provides a clear interface to
the system.

### Requirements for the Basys3 functionality

Create a SystemVerilog design for the Basys3 board that exposes 4 pins
on the PMOD C connector. 3 of these pins will be inputs and one will
be an output. The pins should be connected to the raspberry pi in the
following way.

| Raspberry Pi Pin      | Basys3 Pin       |  Basys3 Functionality |
| -----                 | ------           |  --------             |
| GPIO10 (Output)       |  JC[0] (Input)   | LED Selector [0]      |
| GPIO11 (Output)       |  JC[1] (Input)   | LED Selector [1]      | 
| GPIO8 (Output)        |  JC[2] (Input)   | LED Selector [2]      |
| GPIO9 (Input)         |  JC[3] (Output)  | SW[0]                 |
| GND (Pin 20)          |  PMOD C Pin 5    | Ground                |


Your Basys3 design should light one based on the state of the 3 LED
selector pins where LED Selector [2] is the most significant bit. For
example, if the LED Selector state is 3'b000, LED[0] should light. If
LED selector is 3'b100, LED[4] should light. If LED Selector is
3'b111, LED[7] should light.

The state of SW[0] should be passed back on JC[3]. This will be made
available on the Raspberry pin GPIO9 input.

### Requirements for the python class 

Define a python class named **Basys3_LEDSW** in a file named
**Basys3_LEDSW.py**. This class must have the following methods. You
will also have an init function which you should define. It is fine if
you have other methods beyond what is specified here.

* **write_led(self,led_num)**
  * led_num is between 0 and 7 and represents LED[0] through LED[7] on the Basys3 board 
  * Only one LED can be on at a time 
  * Function does not return a value
  
* **read_switch(self)**
  * returns the state of SW[0] on the Basys3 board. 
  * a returned 1 indicates that the switch is on and a 0 indicates that the switch is off. 

After your class definition, include a test for your system that does the following: 

* Take a floating point frequency between 3 and 10 Hz from the
  user. The period between lighting the LEDs is 1/Frequency. The
  on-time of the LED is the length of the period.
* Instantiate a Basys3_LEDSW. 
* Cycle through the leds at the rate specified by the user. The LEDs
  should run from LED[0]-LED[7] and then start again at LED[0] when
  the switch is off. The LEDs should run from LED[7]-LED[0] and then
  start again at LED[7] when the switch is high.
* The user can change the direction of cycling with the switch during operation. 
* The used cannot change the frequency once the program has started. 

### What to turn in 

You and your partner should work to complete this module and commit it
to your repository. When you are satisfied with the code, go to canvas
and submit a video of your system running. The video should show
operation at 3Hz and at 10Hz. At a given frequency, it should be
demonstrated that the switch can control the direction that the LEDs
are cycling.
