# Connecting the Raspberry Pi and the Baysys3 Board 

![Full Block Diagram](art/blocks_full.png)

## Project 7

### Overview

In this project, you will be connecting the Basys3 board to the
Raspberry Pi. This will be done with GPIO Pins. You will leverage your
experience from earlier this semester with System Verilog to design
the hardware that is instantiated on the Basys3 board. Additionally,
you will be creating a python class that provides a clear interface to
the system.

### Resources
* [Python Classes](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/classes.html)

### Requirements for the Basys3 functionality

Create a SystemVerilog design that does the folowing. 

### Requirements for the python class 



### Creating the lps331 class

Your assignment is to complete the methods in the following class. 



```python 
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import smbus
import sys

class lps331:
    ''' allows connection from Raspberry pi to I2C connected lps331 '''

    def __init__(self,raspberry_pi_i2c_port=1):
        self.i2c_port_number = raspberry_pi_i2c_port
        self.bus = smbus.SMBus(self.i2c_port_number)
        self.address = self.find_sensor()
        if (self.address == 0):
            print("Error: could not read from sensor at i2c address 0x5d")
            sys.exit()
        self.enable_sensor()
        
    def find_sensor(self):
        ''' read the whoami byte from i2c address 0x5d and confirm to be 0xbb '''
        # Return the address if found (0x5d) and 0 if not found
        
        # @@@@ Your Code Here @@@@ 
        
        return(0);   # if the sensor was not located on either bus, return -1

   def i2c_address(self):
        return(self.address)

    def sample_once(self):
        ''' Cause the sensor to sample one time '''
        
        # @@@@ Your Code Here @@@@ 
        
        pass
        
    def read_temperature(self):
        ''' Sample, read temperature registers, and convert to inhg ''' 
        tempC = 0

        # @@@@ Your Code Here @@@@ 
        
        return(tempC)

    def read_pressure(self):
        ''' Sample, read pressure registers, and convert to inhg ''' 
        press_inhg = 0
        
        # @@@@ Your Code Here @@@@ 
        
        return(press_inhg)
    
    def enable_sensor(self):
        ''' Turn on sensor in control register 1'''

        # @@@@ Your Code Here @@@@ 
     
        pass
    
    def disable_sensor(self):
      ''' Turn off sensor in control register 1 '''

        # @@@@ Your Code Here @@@@ 

        pass
        
    def close(self):
        ''' Disable the sensor and close connection to i2c port '''
       self.disable_sensor()
       self.bus.close()
       
if  __name__ == "__main__":
    sensor = lps331(1)
    print("Temperature = %0.2f Deg C "%(sensor.read_temperature()))
    print("Pressure = %0.2f inHg"%(sensor.read_pressure()))
    sensor.close()
```

To test your code, we will instantiate an lps331 object from your
code. Each method will be tested against a working version of the
code.

### What to turn in 
    You and your partner should work to complete this module and
    commit it to your repository. When you are satisfied with the
    code, go to canvas and submit a link to a video of your code
    printing the temperature and the pressure.
