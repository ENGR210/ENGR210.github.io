# ENGR 210 / CSCI B441 Syllabus

Version: SP'2022.2

## Description

This 3-credit* course provides a strong foundation for modern digital system
design using hardware description languages. We start with basics of digital
electronics and learn how digital gates are used to build large digital systems.
We will practice modern digital system design by using state of the art software
tools and implementation of the digital systems on a programmable hardware
platform. At the end of the course, students will be familiar with modern
approach for designing digital systems, using hardware description languages
along with an appropriate methodology.

\* 4 credits given for CSCI-B441.

## Projects

Over the course of the semester, we will assign multiple programming projects.
Full points will requires these projects be submitted to the autograder and be
demonstrated on the FPGA to the TA. Initially, they will be due 1 week after
they are assigned, but the deadlines will gradually increase to several weeks.

## Due Dates and Extensions

**Assignments turned in after the exact time and date on the assignment will
receive a zero**. We do not generally offer extensions. For example, we do not
offer extensions due to crowded computing sites, long queue times or slow
response times on the autograder, internet access problems, accidental erasure
or loss of files, or outside conflicting commitments.

We will consider extension requests made in person and at least two weeks in
advance, for example, for religious holidays or planned medical procedures.
Additionally, we will consider requests for extensions due to documented,
unanticipated medical or personal emergencies. If you can't see the instructor
in advance due to the emergency, then contact them as soon as you possibly can.
In all cases, we require written proof of the emergency.

## Grading

Your final grade is based on scores from the programming projects and two exams. The
tentative point distribution is included in the following table. It is not
likely that this will change, but circumstances might occur which would make
changes necessary, at the discretion of the instructor. *Once a grade has been
posted to Canvas, you will have one week to appeal the grade.*

|    Projects   | Exam 1      | Exam 2 |
| ------------- | ----------- | --------|
| 50%           |    25%      |  25%.   | 


## The Autograder

We will grade your programs in an autograder system that is similar to the Linux
environment. Your code must be submitted, compile, and run correctly on the
autograder before the deadline. We use a web-based autograder for project
submissions. For some projects, the autograder will also evaluate the
thoroughness of test cases you submit.

Note that for security reasons, the autograder website is only accessible from
within the IU network. Therefore, you must either be on campus or connected
through a VPN to access the website.

## Academic Integrity

Learning difficult or complicated material is often facilitated by discussions
between students and we encourage you to form study groups to try to solve
difficult problems together.

However, **exams and programming projects must be your own work**. Do not cheat
in any way: do your own work! Doing your own work means that you must turn in
your own, original work. It means you do not turn in a solution copied from
somebody else or found on the web. In programming projects, working together may
extend to figuring out overall strategies for solution but **you may not work
together or share the actual code** that you submit.

## Disability Services for Students

If you think you need an accommodation for a disability, please let your
instructor know during the first three weeks of the semester. Some aspects of
this course may be modified to facilitate your participation and progress. As
soon as you make us aware of your needs, we can work with the Office of
Disability Services for Students (DSS) help us determine appropriate academic
accommodations. Any information you provide is private and confidential and will
be treated as such.

## Corrections and Clarifications

We will post a Canvas announcement in the case of any critical corrections or
clarifications. It is your responsibility to ensure you are able to receive
Canvas announcements.
